These short demo's describe best practises to map entities with JPA, considering performance and data model consistency.

Points to consider are these:

1. You want to load relationships LAZY as much as possible.
2. You want to keep the amount of queries generated by JPA/Hibernate as low as possible.
3. You want the database to stay small and logical: no unnecessary tables, columns, keys and so on.

Some conclusions:

1. When there is no need to use a bidirectional relationship, use unidirectional (except OneToMany!) and use a query to
   fetch the other side.
2. Unidirectional OneToMany is evil: use alternatives.
    - If you really need OneToMany Uni, use join fetch JPQL queries to fetch the many side, combined with DISTINCT to
      prevent duplicate results.
3. Bidirectional OneToMany is equal to bidirectional ManyToOne.

We've used several sources, which are mentioned in the code.
